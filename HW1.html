		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)">Swimming</a> is an individual or team sport that requires the use of one's entire body
		to move through water. The sport takes place in pools or open water (e.g., in a 
		sea or lake). Competitive swimming is one of the most popular Olympic sports, with 
		varied distance events in butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle, and
		individual medley. In addition to these individual events, four swimmers can take 
		part in either a freestyle or medley relay. A medley relay consists of four 
		swimmers who will each swim a different stroke, ordered as backstroke,breaststroke
		,butterfly and freestyle.Swimming each stroke requires a set of specific 
		techniques; in competition, there are distinct regulations concerning the 
		acceptable form for each individual stroke.There are also regulations on what
		types of swimsuits, caps, jewelry and injury tape that are allowed at competitions
		Although it is possible for competitive swimmers to incur several injuries from 
		the sport, such as tendinitis in the shoulders or knees, there are also multiple 
		health benefits associated with the sport.

		<b>Swim Styles</b><br>
		In competitive swimming, four major styles have been established. These have been
		relatively stable over the last 30â€“40 years with minor improvements. They are:
		<ul type="square">
			<li>Butterfly</li>
			<li>Breaststroke</li>
			<li>Backstroke</li>
			<li>Freestyle</li>
		</ul>
		<br>SwimWear:
		<dl>
			<dt>Swim Cap</dt>
			<dd>A swim cap (a.k.a. cap) keeps the swimmer's hair out of the way to 
			reduce drag. Caps may be made of latex, silicone, spandex or lycra.</dd>
			<dt>Goggles</dt>
			<dd>Goggles keep water and chlorine out of swimmers' eyes. Goggles may be tinted to 
			counteract glare at outdoor pools. Prescription goggles may be used by swimmers who 
			wear corrective lenses.</dd>
